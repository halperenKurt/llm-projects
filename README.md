# üß† LLM Projects
This repository contains my experiments and projects built around Large Language Models (LLMs).
The main goal is to explore various models and frameworks to develop practical Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for real-world problems.

### 1. üìù Text Summarization with Ollama
  -Summarizes long texts while preserving meaning and coherence.
  -Uses a locally running LLM model via Ollama ‚Äî no external API dependency.
  -Focuses on evaluating the performance and fluency of local models in summarization tasks.
